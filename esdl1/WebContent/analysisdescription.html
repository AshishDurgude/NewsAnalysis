	<h1><kbd>News Analysis</kbd></h1>
   <p class="bg-success"><strong>News analysis</strong> refers to the measurement of the various qualitative and quantitative attributes of textual (unstructured data) news stories.
   Some of these attributes are:<strong> sentiment</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong>, and <strong>novelty</strong>.
   Expressing news stories as numbers and metadata permits the manipulation of everyday information in a mathematical and statistical way.<p>

									The application of sophisticated linguistic analysis to news and social media has grown from an area of research to mature product solutions since 2007.
									News analytics and news sentiment calculations are now routinely used by both buy-side and sell side in alpha generation, trading execution,
									risk management, and market surveillance and compliance. There is however a good deal of variation in the quality, effectiveness and completeness of currently available solutions.

						 <pre>This video is Basically based on UNSC Reforms Notes.
		<code>Why UNSC reform is necessary?</code>
			The Institution formed to meet the challenges of   post-world war 2 scenario.  It failed to cope up with the dynamics of post-soviet era world order. As for the UN itself, reform of the Security Council is an existential requirement for the organization. If it resists all proposals for change in the years to come, there is a real risk of the UN being sidelined or rival organisations taking over its agenda.
			Geo political rivalry among the P5 has prevented the UNSC to come up with effective solutions for dealing with global crisis. EX - Syria. Ban Ki Moon, has said that UNSC has failed Syria. 
			UNSC failed to play decisively to stop many of the conflicts. Its delayed actions and consequences had worsened Rwandan crisis. It is also been criticized for not taking a forceful action until a catastrophe unfolds.
			No African nation is represented in UNSC where most of its work is focused.

		<code>What is the procedure for Reform?</code>
			It shall involve an Amendment to UN charter. This can only passed if 2/3 of UNGA members agree to it and none of the permanent members opposes to it.
